## Acknowledgements

- For structuring my components i was inspired by Atomic Design Methodology [link](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) but chose to exclude templates and pages as this App doesn't have routing to other pages.
- I used Redux documentation from [link](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-5-async-logic) as guide. I used createAsyncThunk for asynchronous event.
